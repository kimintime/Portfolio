      <p>Hi, and thanks for clicking through to read more about me. 
      I come from more creative pursuits, the world of music and 
      theatre, and more recently that of developmental editing.
      </p> 
      <p>I will always carry these things with me, but the great thing 
      about having that creative drive, is that it can find other 
      outlets, such as software development. Like many of us in the 
      tech world, I always had fun tinkering with computer stuff, 
      but it was the AMKoodari program in 2020 where I discovered a true 
      joy for it.
      </p>
      <p>Deciding to make that transition from editing full 
      time, to pursuing life as a software developer, I applied to 
      Laurea’s BIT program, and have found success there. In IT though, if you want to
      learn more, you have to go out there and get it yourself, which lead me to Integrify Academy,
      where I've recently received certification in fullstack development. My tech stack there was 
      React, Redux, Typescript, C# ASP.NET and Entity Framework, using PostgreSQL and Azure, and my goal
      is to continue to improve my skills, and learn new ones. Every level on my journey
      has been a challenge, but an exciting and welcome one.
      </p> 
      <p>Software Development doesn’t have an end goal, it’s rather in 
      what you create, always learning new skills, honing old ones, and is a lifelong learning 
      process, and that appeals to me. Life’s too short to not try new 
      things, and to not enjoy what you do.
      </p> 
      <p>When I’m not working on expanding my developer knowledge and skills, I enjoy listening to and making 
      music, mostly playing one of my ukuleles nowadays. I also enjoy crafting 
      jewelry pieces, and photography.
      </p>
      <p>Please have a look at my CV for look at more of what I bring, and feel free to contact me via LinkedIn.
